# ua-sonar-push

ConnectALL Sonar Adapter is developed as an extension to the Universal adapter capability of ConnectALL. This adapter specifications will let the user use Sonar with Webhooks to read and write the data in to Sonar. 

Please refer to https://wiki.connectall.com/ca/latest/adapters/universal-adapter for more information

# Usecase

A developer will run the sonar analysis in local build or a CI build that publishes the Security vulnerabilities to the Sonarqube project. The issues reported by Sonar analysis will be synchronized back to Jira, Azure DevOps or other work tracking systems.
